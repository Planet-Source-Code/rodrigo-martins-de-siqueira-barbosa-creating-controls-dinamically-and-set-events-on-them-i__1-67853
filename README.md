## Creating controls dinamically and set events on them IN RUNTIME


</div>

### Description

I've seen many programmers complaining about that they can create controls dinamically, but they can't seem to set events to them... with this little program now you can do it. I've done a little calculator example to show how powerful it can be. Enjoy =) (Here I'm using Ms Script control to set the events)
 
### More Info
 
The user should at least have heard about subclassing. It's no great deal, but surely will help understand the code.
